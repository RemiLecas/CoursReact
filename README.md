React Project:

This project allows us to create magic cards and store them in a FireBase database.

However it has some small problems that I can't solve indeed we can add a map but when it is done there is a problem with the route which does not redirect us to the Home page. In addition, when we modify or delete a card, this is done but the page is not refreshed.

I think these are simple errors to fix but I can't fix them T_T.
